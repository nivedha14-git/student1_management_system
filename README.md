1. Datatypes: Used in Student class for name, age, and score attributes.
2. OOPs: Implemented through classes and objects (Student and StudentManager).
3. OOP Concepts:
   - Encapsulation: Private fields with public getter and setter methods in the Student class.
   - Polymorphism & Inheritance: Can be explored by adding more entities (like teachers or courses) in future enhancements.
4. Constructor: Student class has a constructor to initialize the object.
5. Scanner: Used to get input from the user in various methods.
6. Casting: Can be demonstrated when converting numeric input (like score) if needed.
7. Array (ArrayList): A dynamic array (List<Student>) is used to store multiple students.
8. String: Used to manipulate and display student data.
9. Conditional Statements: Used in calculateGrade method to determine student grades.
10. Looping Statements: Used to iterate over the student list when displaying or searching.
11. Switch Statement: Used in the Main class for menu options.
12. Collection (List, Set, Map): 
    - List for storing students.
    - Set for searching unique student names.
    - Map for associating students with their grades.
13. Exception Handling: Used in StudentManager to handle invalid user input during student creation.
